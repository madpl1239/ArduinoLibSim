# ArduinoLibSim

The code simulates two libraries for Arduino: tinyGPS++ and softwareSerial. These libraries work on different systems (they are platform independent) and can be compiled using gcc or another compiler. They do not require additional libraries for operation - for now:)) I wrote these libraries to simulate the operation of Arduino with a GPS module, but without using the Arduino IDE. It is only a loose simulation of these libraries and contains only a few methods necessary to simulate reading latitude and longitude from GPS:))
